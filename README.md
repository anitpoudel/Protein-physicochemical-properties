# Protein-Physicochemical-Properties

Batch process molecular weight and isoelectric point of protein sequences using **Biopython**.

## Instructions

1. Prepare your protein sequences in **FASTA format** (e.g., `your_protein.fasta`) from NCBI or other databases.
2. Download `protein_physicochemical.py` and edit it to match your FASTA file name if needed.
3. Keep both `your_protein.fasta` and `protein_physicochemical.py` in the **same directory**.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
5. Run the code:
   python protein_physicochemical.py
6. Get molecular weight and isoelctric point along with corresponding protein name and amino acid sequence in excel file
